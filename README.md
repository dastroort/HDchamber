# HDchamber (Hyper-Dimensional Chamber)

## A web environment built in HTML, CSS and JS to render higher-dimensional geometries such as a Tesseract!

HDchamber is a rendering environment built in vanilla JavaScript, where geometric figures from higher dimensions are brought to life.

## Features

- Real-time rendering of hyper-dimensional geometric objects.
- Adjustable dimension count (from 2D up to 6D).
- Fully built with vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks required.

## Currently supported meshes

- **Hypercube**: the n-dimensional analog of square and cube.
